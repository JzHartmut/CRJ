This folder contains a visual Studio Project for an example using String processing with the simple variant
of StringJc. It should use a minimum of source files to demonstrate the dependency of the source files.

The *.dsp file is from Microsoft Visual Studio Version 6. It should be able to import to an existing higher version of that tool.
On the other hand you can manually read out the *.dsp file and adapt it to another development environment.
