 * @content This file defines only the struct ObjectJc_t and the base interface ObjectJcpp.
 * It is the minimal base for some struct or interface of the framework layer,
 * which should also be designable without knowledge of the Jc-layer, 
 * but useable outside of the users algorithm if necessary with ReflectionJc-concept.
 *
 * @author Hartmut Schorrig
 * @version 2.0
 * list of changes:
 * 2019-10: Hartmut combined with DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE
 * 2008-04-22: JcHartmut chg:The elements idSemaphore and idWaitingThread are combined to idSyncHandles.
 *                       New element offsetToHeapBlock, but not in use yet.
 * 2007-10-00: JcHartmut creation, dissolved from ObjectJc.h
